                    Has one of your sheaths come apart? We happen to enjoy working with leather and will be
                    happy to make a sheath for your knife. We use 8oz cowhide, formed to fit your knife and hand
                    stitched.
                    Each one of our knives comes with a custom-made sheath designed to fit your knife perfectly.

                    Do you have a special knife that has been in your family for generations and needs repair? If you

                    old knife, knife blade or a great knife that needs to be restored, let us know what your idea is,
                    and we
                    might be able help fix it for you. We enjoy restoring knives to their former glory.
