        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <p>My idea for this website is to create an easy-to-use website dedicated to my grandfathers knife making
            business.
            Customers will be able to buy knives that he has already built from this website.
            Have you ever dreamed of owning a unique knife that no one else has?
            Let us know what your dream knife is, and we will get you a quote for how much is will cost to make it.
            With over 35 years of experience, we are the best in the custom knife making business.</p>

        <h3>About Us</h3>
        <p>
            When our founder first started to make knives, he didn't start making knives as a hobby or to have something
            to do. He was living in Alaska and bought some remote property between Anchorage and Fairbanks. He knew that
            he needed some way to make money or trade for the things he would need. He hunted and fished all his life
            and knew how important a good knife was. So, he decided to start building custom knives. He started
            Bloodworth Custom Knives over 35 years ago and haven’t stopped making knives since.

            Our knives have always been made with the finest materials available, and each knife is totally made in our
            shop. We grind the steel; heat treat the blade and finish the knife and sheath here in our shop. Above all
            our knives are “using knives”. If a knife won't cut, it isn't a knife. Bloodworth knives are balanced and
            feel good in your hand. The knives are strong and are designed to last a lifetime. Our sheaths are handmade,
            and hand stitched and fitted for your knife. We have High Standards for our knives, and we have customers
            tell us that their Bloodworth is the best knife they have ever owned.
