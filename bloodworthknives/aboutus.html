                <p id="p1">
                    When our founder first started to make knives, he didn't start making knives as a hobby or to have
                    something to do.
                    He was living in Alaska and bought some remote property between Anchorage and Fairbanks. He knew
                    that he needed some
                    way to make money or trade for the things he would need. He hunted and fished all his life and knew
                    how important a
                    good knife was. So, he decided to start building custom knives.
                </p>
                <p id="p2">
                    He started Bloodworth Custom Knives over 35 years ago and have not stopped making knives since. Our
                    knives have always
                    been made with the finest materials available, and each knife is totally made in our shop. We grind
                    the steel; heat
                    treat the blade and finish the knife and sheath here in our shop. Above all our knives are “using
                    knives”. If a knife
                    won't cut, it isn't a knife. Bloodworth knives are balanced and feel good in your hand. The knives
                    are strong and are
                    designed to last a lifetime. Our sheaths are handmade, and hand stitched and fitted for your knife.
                    We have High Standards
                    for our knives, and we have customers tell us that their Bloodworth is the best knife they have ever
                    owned.
