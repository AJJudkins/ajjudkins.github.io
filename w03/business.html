    <h2>About Us</h2>

    <p> Bloodworth custom knives started 35 years ago when our founder, <br>
        Roger Smith, moved to Alaska. After building his own home, he looked <br>
        for a means of income, which is when he started building custom , <br>
        knives. His legacy that he created 35 years ago carries on today through <br>
        his grandchildren who have spent countless hours by his side learning the <br>
        very same techniques that he perfected.
